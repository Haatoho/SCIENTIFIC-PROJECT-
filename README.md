PREVALENCE OF HOOKWORM INFECTION AMONG PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN GWER-EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, BENUE STATE - NIGERIA.
*T.N. Haatoho.
This parasitological survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of Hookworm parasites among some pupils in three public primary schools located in the three major districts of Gwer-East Local Government Area of Benue State, Nigeria. Stool samples were collected by random sampling and processed using direct wet film and concentration techniques. Chi-square test was employed at 0.05 level of significance for data analysis. Findings revealed that out of 336(180 males and 156 female) pupils between the ages of 4 and 15 years examined, 78(23.21%) were positive for Hookworm with peak infectivity in the age group 13-15 years (8.63%). Males were observed to be more infected (12.50%) than females (10.71%) without a statistical significance (P>0.05). Presence of Hookworm in relation to predisposing factors of the infection was also assessed. The prevalence of Hookworm in the study was found to be significant (P<0.05) in relation to the method of human faecal disposal.  It was recommended that adequate toilet facilities, good health education, safe water and a deviation from walking barefoot will minimize hookworm infection in school children.
